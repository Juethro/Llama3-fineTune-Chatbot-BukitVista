I’d like to express my absolute disappointment at our treatment at bingin ombak this evening. At 9.00pm we asked if we could get some drinks in which we were told yes, asking for 3x bintangs and 6x vodka shots. It was my partners birthday (also staying in The bingin ombak accommodation with me) so they said that it was ok and brought out the drinks as requested. To be clear - We were not served vodka. We are unsure of what alcohol we were served as these shots - I assumed a form of arak? As the beers came out first, by the time the shots were consumed the bartenders had left and there were only two older women left at the warung who could not help. The shots served had my partner vomiting profusely - he has only just fallen asleep after all of this. \\n\\nI’m so disappointed as we’d heard of other places serving dodgy alcohol in Bali but expected so much more from a place we’ve been to before, and we’re excited to get back to. I will be making it clear on all forums to not drink at bingin ombak, as they do not serve what is asked for. I ask that you assist us in requesting our money back for these drinks, as a partner/owner of bingin ombak. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Again we’ve been so excited to come back to this location since before covidand for bingin ombak to serve a substandard drink and expect us to pay for more not only is dodgy, it’s extremely dangerous as you do not know what effect this can have on your patrons.'},\n",

Based on the concept of Tri Hita Karana, The Monkey Forest Ubud will be a featured of international tourist destination to create peace and harmony to the visitor.\\n\\n2. Campuhan Ridge Walk\\nThe Campuhan Ridge Walk is arguably the best known Ubud trek and with good reason. The sparse crowds and the aesthetically rich vistas remind one of why people from around the world come to Bali. The trail starts at the historical origin of Ubud, the confluence (or Campuhan) of the Wos Rivers.\\n\\n3. Saraswati Temple\\nSaraswati temple Kingdom of Ubud is dedicated to honor the Hindu Goddess Saraswati, the goddess of learning, literature and art. This temple is very beautiful and artistic, so many tourists who come to see its charm, but for purposes of worship. Pura Taman Saraswati has a water garden and lotus pond at the center of its attraction as a tourist attraction.\\n\\nLet us know if any of them intrigues you!

Kelingking Beach\\nKelingking beach is a secret point in Nusa Penida. There is a spot called Manta Point here, where you could dive around and witness manta rays the biggest sting ray ever. Brave your fear and swim freely with them. Find a whole different level of diving sensation here. The view of the landscape is also breathtaking and beautiful.\\n\\n2. Goa Giri Putri Temple\\nTemple built in one of the largest caves in Nusa Penida, accessed by a winding staircase.\\n\\n3. Crystal Bay Nusa Penida\\nFrom the name itself, you probably could guess that Crystal Bay Beach has one of the most crystal clear water in Nusa Penida. The beach is a really quiet and almost feel like a private beach. The sand stretch over 200 meters with a turtle like mini island floating in front of it.\\n\\nLet us know if any of them intrigues you! We would love to hear how much fun you’ll have in those places as well.

Kelingking Beach\\nKelingking beach is a secret point in Nusa Penida. There is a spot called Manta Point here, where you could dive around and witness manta rays the biggest sting ray ever. Brave your fear and swim freely with them. Find a whole different level of diving sensation here. The view of the landscape is also breathtaking and beautiful.\\n\\n2. Goa Giri Putri Temple\\nTemple built in one of the largest caves in Nusa Penida, accessed by a winding staircase.\\n\\n3. Crystal Bay Nusa Penida\\nFrom the name itself, you probably could guess that Crystal Bay Beach has one of the most crystal clear water in Nusa Penida. The beach is a really quiet and almost feel like a private beach. The sand stretch over 200 meters with a turtle like mini island floating in front of it.\\n\\nLet us know if any of them intrigues you!

Based on the concept of Tri Hita Karana, The Monkey Forest Ubud will be a featured of international tourist destination to create peace and harmony to the visitor.\\n\\n2. Campuhan Ridge Walk\\nThe Campuhan Ridge Walk is arguably the best known Ubud trek and with good reason. The sparse crowds and the aesthetically rich vistas remind one of why people from around the world come to Bali. The trail starts at the historical origin of Ubud, the confluence (or Campuhan) of the Wos Rivers.\\n\\n3. Saraswati Temple\\nSaraswati temple Kingdom of Ubud is dedicated to honor the Hindu Goddess Saraswati, the goddess of learning, literature and art. This temple is very beautiful and artistic, so many tourists who come to see its charm, but for purposes of worship. Pura Taman Saraswati has a water garden and lotus pond at the center of its attraction as a tourist attraction.\\n\\nLet us know if any of them intrigues you!

Kelingking Beach\\nKelingking beach is a secret point in Nusa Penida. There is a spot called Manta Point here, where you could dive around and witness manta rays the biggest sting ray ever. Brave your fear and swim freely with them. Find a whole different level of diving sensation here. The view of the landscape is also breathtaking and beautiful.\\n\\n2. Goa Giri Putri Temple\\nTemple built in one of the largest caves in Nusa Penida, accessed by a winding staircase.\\n\\n3. Crystal Bay Nusa Penida\\nFrom the name itself, you probably could guess that Crystal Bay Beach has one of the most crystal clear water in Nusa Penida. The beach is a really quiet and almost feel like a private beach. The sand stretch over 200 meters with a turtle like mini island floating in front of it.\\n\\nLet us know if any of them intrigues you!

Campuhan Ridge Walk\\nThe Campuhan Ridge Walk is arguably the best known Ubud trek and with good reason.

Saraswati Temple\\nSaraswati temple Kingdom of Ubud is dedicated to honor the Hindu Goddess Saraswati, the goddess of learning, literature and art.

It is a space created for you to escape the roller coasters of life, to unwind the complexities of the mind and to indulge in life's little pleasures.\\n\\n2. Canggu Beach\\nCanggu Beach is mostly famous as a place for surfing with 2 famous beaches : Echo Beach, world class wave and Batu Bolong also known as Old Man which is the ideal spot for beginners, longboards and funboards. Those 2 beaches are reef breaks. The sand is black on the 2 beaches, but it's also a nice place to rest and watch the surfers.\\n\\nLet us know if any of them intrigues you! We would love to hear how much fun you’ll have in those places as well.

We have got some recommended places that our team has collected to help you enjoy your stay in Ungasan more:\\n\\n1. Melasti Beach\\nSandy strip known for photography & sunset views, backed by rock formations & resort hotels.\\n\\n2. Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park\\nThe towering statue is Bali’s most iconic landmark and depicts the Hindu God Wisnu, atop his mount, the mythical eagle, Garuda. Soaring to a height of over 120 meters, this is one of the tallest monumental statues in the world, higher than both the Statue of Liberty and Christ the Redeemer. Enjoy panoramic island views as you explore the park on foot or by Segway. Indulge in Indonesian heritage cuisine, immerse yourself in a land steeped in mythology, or plan your next big event in one of GWK’s epic venues.\\n\\n3. Karma Kandara Beach\\nEmbody blissful, barefoot, carefree days and glamorous star-filled nights. Karma Kandara Beach offers so much more than pristine ocean waters. Karma Kandara Beach is family-friendly – enjoy fun-filled days of watersports, beachcombing, ocean spa treatments and private cabanas with views over the Indian ocean. Come sunset and immerse in sensual evenings enhanced by DJs, live music, cocktails and seafood feasts.\\n\\nLet us know if any of them intrigues you! We would love to hear how much fun you’ll have in those places as well.

Therapy Canggu\\nTherapy, a contemporary sanctuary with an extraordinary subtle Balinese vibe, ushers you to de-stress like never before. It is a space created for you to escape the roller coasters of life, to unwind the complexities of the mind and to indulge in life's little pleasures.\\n\\n2. Canggu Beach\\nCanggu Beach is mostly famous as a place for surfing with 2 famous beaches : Echo Beach, world class wave and Batu Bolong also known as Old Man which is the ideal spot for beginners, longboards and funboards. Those 2 beaches are reef breaks. The sand is black on the 2 beaches, but it's also a nice place to rest and watch the surfers.\\n\\nLet us know if any of them intrigues you! We would love to hear how much fun you’ll have in those places as well. If you have visited those places or have any pictures during the stay in our villa, feel free to tag us on our instagram @bukitvista .\\n\\nHave a fun and delightful stay!\\nLila & Bukit Vista Hosts\"},\n",

Sacred Monkey Forest Sanctuary\\nThe mission of The Sacred Monkey Forest Sanctuary (Monkey Forest Ubud) is conserving the area based on the concept of Tri Hita Karana. Based on the concept of Tri Hita Karana, The Monkey Forest Ubud will be a featured of international tourist destination to create peace and harmony to the visitor.\\n\\n2. Campuhan Ridge Walk\\nThe Campuhan Ridge Walk is arguably the best known Ubud trek and with good reason. The sparse crowds and the aesthetically rich vistas remind one of why people from around the world come to Bali. The trail starts at the historical origin of Ubud, the confluence (or Campuhan) of the Wos Rivers.\\n\\n3. Saraswati Temple\\nSaraswati temple Kingdom of Ubud is dedicated to honor the Hindu Goddess Saraswati, the goddess of learning, literature and art. This temple is very beautiful and artistic, so many tourists who come to see its charm, but for purposes of worship. Pura Taman Saraswati has a water garden and lotus pond at the center of its attraction as a tourist attraction.\\n\\nLet us know if any of them intrigues you! We would love to hear how much fun you’ll have in those places as well.

We know our accommodation is located in the forest, but both of us, me and my boyfriend lived in forests before.\\nThe problem is that our accommodation has openings in the ceiling, letting big animals as frogs and big lizards (around 18-25cm) walking in the sleeping room\\nand bathroom. They poop and pee from above making the whole floor dirty.. They also walk exactly above the bed where we sleep and we can hear them at night.\\nOne time they also pooped in the bed. The staff here tried to get rid of them after us complaining multiple times, but unsuccessful. They still walking around and pooping,\\nthe cleaning stuff sees the poop when they clean it but they just ignore it.. \\n\\n2)\\nSecond problem that we had and have is water running from the ceiling in the bathroom and kitchen every time it rained / rains.  Sadly the problem isn’t solved and we have to clean it ourselves every time it rains.\\n\\n3)\\nA major problem we had this last week were bedbugs. We both have multiple bites\\nall over our whole body.. \\nOnce we noticed and talked to the staff & host to change the bed & sheets, they offered us a solution of “putting cream to the bites” and “spraying eucalyptus to the bed”.. which we founds was a very cheap and unfair solution.. at the end it didnt bring anything since we woke up with more bites. After more complaints from our side to clean properly.. they finally decided to bring a pest control worker to clean the bed & they offered us another hotel for one night. But it only happened after we had to really put pressure after 3+ days to make it happen.\\n\\n4)\\nLast, mould in the bathroom, our sleeping room, bags & clothes.\\nOne of the worst things you can have in a room you breathe and sleep is mold.\\nAround 1,5 weeks ago we noticed mushrooms growing inside the bathroom..\\nWhen we told the staff, someone came and just cut it with his arm.. that was it.\\nFew days ago, we left our backpacks in the room, touching the wall since we hadn't used them for a few days. When we wanted to use them again we noticed that both were completely WHITE like flour.. sadly we were pissed at the moment and forgot to take a picture.. then we noticed it on our clothes. \\nToday I saw white mold growing in the bathroom walls… the solution from the staff was to “spray it with eucalyptus spray” again… and now today its grown back as it was..\"},\n",

It is a space created for you to escape the roller coasters of life, to unwind the complexities of the mind and to indulge in life's little pleasures.\\n\\n2. Canggu Beach\\nCanggu Beach is mostly famous as a place for surfing with 2 famous beaches : Echo Beach, world class wave and Batu Bolong also known as Old Man which is the ideal spot for beginners, longboards and funboards. Those 2 beaches are reef breaks. The sand is black on the 2 beaches, but it's also a nice place to rest and watch the surfers.\\n\\nLet us know if any of them intrigues you! We would love to hear how much fun you’ll have in those places as well.

Campuhan Ridge Walk\\nThe Campuhan Ridge Walk is arguably the best known Ubud trek and with good reason.

We have got some recommended places that our team has collected to help you enjoy your stay in Canggu more:\\n\\n1. Therapy Canggu\\nTherapy, a contemporary sanctuary with an extraordinary subtle Balinese vibe, ushers you to de-stress like never before. It is a space created for you to escape the roller coasters of life, to unwind the complexities of the mind and to indulge in life's little pleasures.\\n\\n2. Canggu Beach\\nCanggu Beach is mostly famous as a place for surfing with 2 famous beaches : Echo Beach, world class wave and Batu Bolong also known as Old Man which is the ideal spot for beginners, longboards and funboards. Those 2 beaches are reef breaks. The sand is black on the 2 beaches, but it's also a nice place to rest and watch the surfers.\\n\\nLet us know if any of them intrigues you! We would love to hear how much fun you’ll have in those places as well. If you have visited those places or have any pictures during the stay in our villa, feel free to tag us on our instagram @bukitvista .\\n\\nHave a fun and delightful stay!\\nLila & Bukit Vista Hosts\"},\n",

It is a space created for you to escape the roller coasters of life, to unwind the complexities of the mind and to indulge in life's little pleasures.\\n\\n2. Canggu Beach\\nCanggu Beach is mostly famous as a place for surfing with 2 famous beaches : Echo Beach, world class wave and Batu Bolong also known as Old Man which is the ideal spot for beginners, longboards and funboards. Those 2 beaches are reef breaks. The sand is black on the 2 beaches, but it's also a nice place to rest and watch the surfers.\\n\\nLet us know if any of them intrigues you! We would love to hear how much fun you’ll have in those places as well.

Kelingking Beach\\nKelingking beach is a secret point in Nusa Penida. There is a spot called Manta Point here, where you could dive around and witness manta rays the biggest sting ray ever. Brave your fear and swim freely with them. Find a whole different level of diving sensation here. The view of the landscape is also breathtaking and beautiful.\\n\\n2. Goa Giri Putri Temple\\nTemple built in one of the largest caves in Nusa Penida, accessed by a winding staircase.\\n\\n3. Crystal Bay Nusa Penida\\nFrom the name itself, you probably could guess that Crystal Bay Beach has one of the most crystal clear water in Nusa Penida. The beach is a really quiet and almost feel like a private beach. The sand stretch over 200 meters with a turtle like mini island floating in front of it.\\n\\nLet us know if any of them intrigues you! We would love to hear how much fun you’ll have in those places as well.

It is a space created for you to escape the roller coasters of life, to unwind the complexities of the mind and to indulge in life's little pleasures.\\n\\n2. Canggu Beach\\nCanggu Beach is mostly famous as a place for surfing with 2 famous beaches : Echo Beach, world class wave and Batu Bolong also known as Old Man which is the ideal spot for beginners, longboards and funboards. Those 2 beaches are reef breaks. The sand is black on the 2 beaches, but it's also a nice place to rest and watch the surfers.\\n\\nLet us know if any of them intrigues you!

I am planing on staying for a longer time, but for my arrival I’d like to book Airbnb. I am interested in renting your place for a month starting from the 27th of March.\\n\\nI still have some questions though: is your internet strong enough, since I will be working from home? I saw that cleaning is included but is it included for longer stays and how often? The most important part of my request is cancelation policy.\\n\\nSince I want to make sure to have a place to stay when I arrive on time, but at the same time regulations change daily, is it possible to change the starting date after booking with 3 days. I am asking because quarantine is now obligatory but it’s expected to drop on the 14th of March (still unsure). If it doesn’t I will arrive three days later than booked. Therefore it would be great if we could arrange this. \\n\\nLooking forward to hearing from you.\\n'},\n",

There will be Indonesian and Balinese artworks but also numerous paintings by those bohemian artists who came from Europe and other parts of the world starting from the 1930s, succumbing to the spells of the enchanting tropical Island.\\n\\n3.

There is a spot called Manta Point here, where you could dive around and witness manta rays the biggest sting ray ever. Brave your fear and swim freely with them. Find a whole different level of diving sensation here. The view of the landscape is also breathtaking and beautiful.\\n\\n2. Goa Giri Putri Temple\\nTemple built in one of the largest caves in Nusa Penida, accessed by a winding staircase.\\n\\n3. Crystal Bay Nusa Penida\\nFrom the name itself, you probably could guess that Crystal Bay Beach has one of the most crystal clear water in Nusa Penida. The beach is a really quiet and almost feel like a private beach. The sand stretch over 200 meters with a turtle like mini island floating in front of it.\\n\\nLet us know if any of them intrigues you!

We have got some recommended places that our team has collected to help you enjoy your stay in Canggu more:\\n\\n1. Therapy Canggu\\nTherapy, a contemporary sanctuary with an extraordinary subtle Balinese vibe, ushers you to de-stress like never before. It is a space created for you to escape the roller coasters of life, to unwind the complexities of the mind and to indulge in life's little pleasures.\\n\\n2. Canggu Beach\\nCanggu Beach is mostly famous as a place for surfing with 2 famous beaches : Echo Beach, world class wave and Batu Bolong also known as Old Man which is the ideal spot for beginners, longboards and funboards. Those 2 beaches are reef breaks. The sand is black on the 2 beaches, but it's also a nice place to rest and watch the surfers.\\n\\nLet us know if any of them intrigues you! We would love to hear how much fun you’ll have in those places as well. If you have visited those places or have any pictures during the stay in our villa, feel free to tag us on our instagram @bukitvista .\\n\\nHave a fun and delightful stay!\\nLila & Bukit Vista Hosts\"},\n",

Based on the concept of Tri Hita Karana, The Monkey Forest Ubud will be a featured of international tourist destination to create peace and harmony to the visitor.\\n\\n2. Campuhan Ridge Walk\\nThe Campuhan Ridge Walk is arguably the best known Ubud trek and with good reason. The sparse crowds and the aesthetically rich vistas remind one of why people from around the world come to Bali. The trail starts at the historical origin of Ubud, the confluence (or Campuhan) of the Wos Rivers.\\n\\n3. Saraswati Temple\\nSaraswati temple Kingdom of Ubud is dedicated to honor the Hindu Goddess Saraswati, the goddess of learning, literature and art.

Therapy Canggu\\nTherapy, a contemporary sanctuary with an extraordinary subtle Balinese vibe, ushers you to de-stress like never before. It is a space created for you to escape the roller coasters of life, to unwind the complexities of the mind and to indulge in life's little pleasures.\\n\\n2. Canggu Beach\\nCanggu Beach is mostly famous as a place for surfing with 2 famous beaches : Echo Beach, world class wave and Batu Bolong also known as Old Man which is the ideal spot for beginners, longboards and funboards. Those 2 beaches are reef breaks. The sand is black on the 2 beaches, but it's also a nice place to rest and watch the surfers.\\n\\nLet us know if any of them intrigues you! We would love to hear how much fun you’ll have in those places as well.

There is a spot called Manta Point here, where you could dive around and witness manta rays the biggest sting ray ever. Brave your fear and swim freely with them. Find a whole different level of diving sensation here. The view of the landscape is also breathtaking and beautiful.\\n\\n2. Goa Giri Putri Temple\\nTemple built in one of the largest caves in Nusa Penida, accessed by a winding staircase.\\n\\n3. Crystal Bay Nusa Penida\\nFrom the name itself, you probably could guess that Crystal Bay Beach has one of the most crystal clear water in Nusa Penida. The beach is a really quiet and almost feel like a private beach. The sand stretch over 200 meters with a turtle like mini island floating in front of it.\\n\\nLet us know if any of them intrigues you!

We have got some recommended places that our team has collected to help you enjoy your stay in Ubud more:\\n\\n1. Sacred Monkey Forest Sanctuary\\nThe mission of The Sacred Monkey Forest Sanctuary (Monkey Forest Ubud) is conserving the area based on the concept of Tri Hita Karana. Based on the concept of Tri Hita Karana, The Monkey Forest Ubud will be a featured of international tourist destination to create peace and harmony to the visitor.\\n\\n2. Campuhan Ridge Walk\\nThe Campuhan Ridge Walk is arguably the best known Ubud trek and with good reason. The sparse crowds and the aesthetically rich vistas remind one of why people from around the world come to Bali. The trail starts at the historical origin of Ubud, the confluence (or Campuhan) of the Wos Rivers.\\n\\n3. Saraswati Temple\\nSaraswati temple Kingdom of Ubud is dedicated to honor the Hindu Goddess Saraswati, the goddess of learning, literature and art. This temple is very beautiful and artistic, so many tourists who come to see its charm, but for purposes of worship. Pura Taman Saraswati has a water garden and lotus pond at the center of its attraction as a tourist attraction.\\n\\nLet us know if any of them intrigues you!

Based on the concept of Tri Hita Karana, The Monkey Forest Ubud will be a featured of international tourist destination to create peace and harmony to the visitor.\\n\\n2. Campuhan Ridge Walk\\nThe Campuhan Ridge Walk is arguably the best known Ubud trek and with good reason.
